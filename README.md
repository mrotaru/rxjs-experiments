# RxJS

Finally, got around to experimenting with reactive programming, more specifically, RxJS.
This repository is just the code-along for https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-reactive-programming

- http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/overview.html
- large API surface: http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html
- to be truly productive with it, need to spend a lot of time learning the operators
- in a React/Redux context, would be similar to `redux-saga`
